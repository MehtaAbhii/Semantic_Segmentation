# U-Net

### Overview
Its distinct feature is its U-shaped structure, comprising an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is responsible for progressively reducing the input image's spatial dimensions and extracting high-level features through a series of convolutional and pooling layers. In contrast, the decoder part focuses on upsampling and generating a segmentation map by employing convolutional layers and up-sampling operations. One of the key strengths of U-Net lies in its extensive use of skip connections, linking corresponding layers between the encoder and decoder
