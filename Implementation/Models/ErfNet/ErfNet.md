### Overview
ERFNet, which stands for Efficient Residual Factorized ConvNet, is a deep learning architecture designed for   real-time semantic segmentation tasks in computer vision. It was developed to balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. ERFNet achieves this by using factorized convolutions and residual connections to reduce  the number of parameters and computations while maintaining good segmentation performance. It's a notable architecture for applications like autonomous driving and image understanding where real-time processing is crucial.
