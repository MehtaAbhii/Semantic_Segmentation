# ADE20K Dataset
## Overview: 
### Purpose: 
Semantic Segmentation, Scene Parsing, Object Recognition
### Number of Classes: 
150 object categories, including objects, stuff (e.g., sky, grass), and things (e.g., cars, chairs).
### Number of Images: 
Over 20,000 images for training and 2,000 images for validation/testing.
### Data Collection: 
The dataset features images from diverse scenes and environments, including indoor and outdoor settings. Images are collected from a wide range of sources, including internet images, professional photography, and user-generated content.
### Annotations: 
ADE20K provides pixel-wise annotations for all images. Each pixel in an image is labeled with the category it belongs to, making it suitable for semantic segmentation tasks. Each image can contain multiple object categories and stuff classes, each with a distinct label.
